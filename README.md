# Test Blog Application

My goals for this test blog application: 1) To use Unit of Work design pattern 2) To implement a workflow system for the blog (i.e. Approval and Rejection based on user roles) 

The entire site is built using these technologies: 1) ASP.NET MVC 5 2) Entity Framework 6 (Code First) 3) Twitter Bootsrap (HTML/Javascript/CSS) 4) jQuery

To improve: 1) Look and feel of the workflow system 2) Assigning of roles into specific part of the workflow system
