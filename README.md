# Test Blog Application

Below are my goals for this test blog application:
-To use Unit of Work design pattern 
-To implement a workflow system for the blog (i.e. Approval and Rejection based on user roles)

The entire site is built using the below technologies:
-ASP.NET MVC 5
-Entity Framework 6 (Code First)
-Twitter Bootsrap (HTML/Javascript/CSS)
-jQuery

To improve:
-Look and feel of the workflow system
-Assigning of roles into specific part of the workflow system
